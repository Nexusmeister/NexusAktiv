# NexusAktiv
This app is for crawling and processing the data of the WKBV (WÃ¼rttembergischer Kegler- und Bowlingverband e.V.) match service [wkbv-aktiv](https://www.wkbv-aktiv.de/).

# Why?
The transparency and usability of the original software is far beyond of good and modern. Historical analysis and deep processing of match data is not possible.
To enable your own club to utilize the data in a more modern way to build knowledge and insights about the game, this repo and the located software will help.

For more detailed information please visit the docs folder.

> Warning: This software is far from finished and is heavily experimental.

# Contributing
If you have ideas or want to add a feature, please fork this repo and implement like you want. Also if you don't want to make changes, please open an Issue to track new feature request.

# Further implementations
As the association decided to shift away from wkbv-aktiv to the new popular solution [Sportwinner](https://www.sportwinner.de/) this repo will be under construction to adapt to the changing infrastructure.
