# AktivCrawler
This repo is for crawling and processing the data of the WKBV (WÃ¼rttembergischer Kegler- und Bowlingverband e.V.) match service wkbv-aktiv.

# Why?
The transparency and usability of the original software is far beyond of good and modern. Historical and deep processing of match data is not possible.
To enable your own club to utilize the data in a more modern way to build knowledge and insights about the game, this repo and the located software will help.
